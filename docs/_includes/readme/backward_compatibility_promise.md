werf follows a versioning strategy called [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). It means that major releases (1.0, 2.0) can break backward compatibility. In the case of werf, an update to the next major release _may_
require to do a full re-deploy of applications or to perform other non-scriptable actions.

Minor releases (1.1, 1.2, etc.) may introduce new global features, but have to do so without significant backward compatibility breaks with a major branch (1.x).
In the case of werf, this means that an update to the next minor release goes smoothly most of the time. However, it _may_ require running a provided upgrade script.

Patch releases (1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2) may introduce new features, but must do so without breaking backward compatibility within the minor branch (1.1.x).
In the case of werf, this means that an update to the next patch release should be smooth and can be done automatically.

Patch releases are divided into channels. Channel is a prefix in a prerelease part of version (1.1.0-alpha.2, 1.1.0-beta.3, 1.1.0-ea.1).
The version without a prerelease part is considered to have originated in a stable channel.

- `stable` channel (1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.). This version is recommended for use in critical environments with tight SLAs.
  We **guarantee** backward compatibility between `stable` releases within the minor branch (1.1.x).
- `ea` channel versions are mostly safe to use. These versions are suitable for all environments.
  We **guarantee** backward compatibility between `ea` releases within the minor branch (1.1.x).
  We **guarantee** that `ea` release should become a `stable` release after at least 2 weeks of broad testing.
- `rc` channel (2.3.2-rc.2). These releases are mostly safe to use and can be used in non-critical environments or for local development.
  We do **not guarantee** backward compatibility between `rc` releases.
  We **guarantee** that `rc` release should become `ea` after at least 1 week of internal testing.
- `beta` channel (1.2.2-beta.0). These releases are for broad testing of new features to catch regressions.
  We do **not guarantee** backward compatibility between `beta` releases.
- `alpha` channel (1.2.2-alpha.12, 2.0.0-alpha.5, etc.). These releases can bring new features but are unstable.
  We do **not guarantee** backward compatibility between `alpha` releases.
